## 📝 About

This is a Kali Linux tools installation script that works across multiple distributions. Whether you're hacking, pen-testing, or just pretending to be a wizard at the terminal, this script has your back.

It auto-detects your Linux distro, grabs the appropriate package manager, and installs a truckload of tools for your inner techie.

No magic required (unless you're using Arch, which is basically black magic).
